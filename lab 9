1.   Write a program which will add your best five students name in a set. You will use a loop to insert names in set.

   INPUT:
      best_students=set()
   for i in range(5):
     x=input("enter name ")
     best_students.add(x)
     print(best_students)  
   OUTPUT:
     enter name noor
     enter name khadija
     enter name ali
     enter name ramsha
     enter name danish
      
    {'khadija', 'ramsha', 'ali', 'noor', 'danish '}






2.   Write a program which will remove 2 friends who left UIT.

          x=input("enter name of friend who left ")
          UIT_friends.remove(x)
     print("so the remaiming friends in UIT are ","\n",UIT_friends) 
   OUTPUT:
    enter name of friend who left ali
    enter name of friend who left hamza
    so the remaiming friends in UIT are
    {'sabhi', 'shahzaib'}





3.   Write a program which will add your best dishes and then pop one by one until the set is empty

   for x in range(3):
     x=input("enter name of dishes ")
     dishes.add(x)
   print("my favourite dishes are","\n",dishes)
   for x in range(len(dishes)):
     dishes.pop()
     print(dishes)
   OUTPUT:
       enter name of dishes aenter name of dishes d
       enter name of dishes g
       my favourite dishes are
       {'g', 'd', 'a'}
       {'d', 'a'}
       {'a'}
       set()







4.   Write a program which will store number of items in a set after each purchasing the items will be pop from the set and compare its price at the end program will give you the total amount of items have been sold. Also find the max amount and minimum amount of items sold
  INPUT:
   s1={"biscuit","shampoo","soap","chips"}
  s2=set()
  dictionary={}
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    s2=s1.pop()
    print("you are providing price of ",s2)
    dictionary[s2]=input("enter price ")
  print(dictionary)
  print("the maximum price of item is ",max(dictionary.values()))
  print("the minimum price of item is ",min(dictionary.values()))
 
OUTPUT:
     you are providing price of chips
     enter price  30
     you are providing price of biscuit
     enter prices  45
     you are providing price of  shampoo
     enter prices  150
     you are providing price of soap
     enter prices  55
     {'shampoo': 150, 'biscuit': 45, 'chips': 30, 'soap': 55}
     total amount of items sold are ', 280)
     the maximum price of item is 150
     the minimum price of item is  30









5.   Write a program which will compare two sets, Set A and Set B. Both the sets have some students who love to play one is hockey and other one is cricket. 10 of them play both. Now using sets find how many of them are playing cricket only, if universal set is 40, students who play hockey are 21.

 INPUT:
  
 total_student=set(range(40))
 print("The total students is: ",len(total_student))
 hockey_players=set(range(21))
 print("The total number of students who play hockey only is: ",
 len(hockey_players))
 hockey_and_cricket_players=set(range(10))
 print("The total number of students who play hockey and
 cricket both is: ",len(hockey_and_cricket_players))   
 a=(len(total_student))+(len(hockey_and_cricket_players))
 cricket_players=a-len(hockey_players)
 print("The total number of students who only play cricket is: ",len(cricket_players))    


OUTPUT:
 
  The total students is:  40
  The total number of students who play hockey only is:  21
  The total number of students who play hockey and cricket both is: 10
  The total number of players who only play cricket is :  29

7.Solve the following problem of real world.
A camp of international students has 110 students, as shown in the diagram. The diagram will elaborate that all the students speak some kind of a language. We need to find out how many that speak none of them out of 110 students.
Find how many students speak
a.    English and Spanish but not French?
b.    Neither English, Spanish, nor French?
c.    French, but neither English nor Spanish?
d.    Only one of the three languages?
e.    Exactly two of the three languages?
 

INPUT:
englishonly=set(range(25))
spanishonly=set(range(10))
frenchonly=set(range(11))
englishandspanishonly=set(range(20))
englishandfrenchonly=set(range(17))
spanishandfrenchonly=set(range(9))
englishspanishandfrenchall=set(range(13))
neitherenglishspanishnorfrench=set(range(5))
onelanguageonly=len(englishonly)+len(spanishonly)+len(frenchonly)
twolanguageonly=len(englishandspanishonly)+len(englishandfrenchonly)+len(spanishandfrenchonly)
print("students speak english and spanish not french is: ",len(englishandspanishonly))
print("students who neither speak english ,spanish nor french is: ",len(neitherenglishspanishnorfrench))
print("students who speak french only is: ",len(frenchonly))
print("students who speak only one language is: ",onelanguageonly)
print("students who speak two languages is: ",twolanguageonly)



OUTPUT:

students speak english and spanish not french is: 20
students who neither speak english ,spanish nor french is: 5
students who speak french only is: 11
